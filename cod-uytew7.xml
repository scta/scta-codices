    a collection of sermons or commentary based on the Gospels, 
    and a Passion narrative. 
    Also commentary on Peter Lombard's Sententiae, 
    concerning God, evil, creation, sin, grace, incarnation, 
    the Ten Commandments, and sacraments (among many other topics); 
    three sermons by Jordan von Quedlinburg, 
    two of which are identified by R. Lievens as numbers 317 and 260;
